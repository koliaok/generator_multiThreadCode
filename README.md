Machine Learning based Multi-Threaded Code Generation Technique for Verifying Concurrency Errors in Java Programs
=================================

# **LSTM-RNN + Reinforcement Learning**

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for word-level language models in Python using Tensorflow.

Inspired from Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn
I change word based LSTM-RNN for learning Java based source code
AC folder is Reinforce Learning of Policy based Actor-Critic Model for making "Multi-Thread Code"

I make the java code generation for multi-thread
